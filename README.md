# 👋 Hi, I'm MUHAMMAD DARWISH BIN MOHD ZAILANI!

### 🚀 About Me
I’m a passionate **Software Engineering** student, currently in my 3RD year, with a focus on building innovative software solutions. My interests lie in **software development**, **maintainable code**, and **solving complex problems** through programming. I enjoy learning about the **software development lifecycle**, particularly how to keep systems running efficiently after they have been deployed.

I’m constantly improving my skills in:
- **Software Design Patterns**
- **Agile Development Practices**
- **Version Control (Git, GitHub)**
- **Testing and Debugging Techniques**

### 📘 WIF3005: Software Maintenance and Evolution

In the WIF3005 course, we explore how to maintain and evolve software systems over time, which is crucial as software requires continuous adaptation. Below are some key expectations for this course:

- **Understanding the Challenges of Maintenance**: Learn about the complexities involved in maintaining software systems, including bug fixes, refactoring, and handling technical debt.
  
- **Software Evolution Processes**: Study the models and methods used to support the continuous evolution of software to meet new requirements and adapt to changes in the environment.

- **Improving Maintainability**: Develop strategies for writing code that is easy to maintain and modify, focusing on best practices like code readability, modularity, and documentation.

- **Hands-On Projects**: Work on real-world software systems to apply concepts such as legacy system management, reverse engineering, and impact analysis.

### 🛠️ Technologies and Tools
- **Languages**: Python, Java, C++, Javascript
- **Frameworks**: React, Flask
- **Tools**: Git, VSCode 

I’m excited to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with other developers. Feel free to connect or reach out!
